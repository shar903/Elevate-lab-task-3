First i used Linear Regression to predict glucose levels from the diabetes dataset. 
After cleaning the data, I split it into training and test sets.
The model was trained on the training data and evaluated using MAE, MSE, and RÂ² metrics.
Results showed how accurately the model predicted glucose levels.
I also analyzed coefficients to see which features had the most impact.
